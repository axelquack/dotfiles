* `fields=0 48 17 18 38 39 40 2 46 47 49 1`: Specifies which columns to display in the process list. The numbers represent the field numbers. For example, 0 represents the process ID, 2 represents the user, 17 represents the process name, and so on.
* `sort_key=46`: Specifies which column to use for sorting the process list. In this case, it is column 46, which represents the CPU usage percentage.
* `sort_direction=1`: Specifies the sort direction. 0 would be descending, and 1 would be ascending.
* `hide_threads=0`: If set to 1, hides individual threads and shows only processes.
* `hide_kernel_threads=1`: If set to 1, hides kernel threads.
* `hide_userland_threads=0`: If set to 1, hides userland threads.
* `shadow_other_users=0`: If set to 1, highlights processes running under different users.
* `highlight_base_name=0`: If set to 1, highlights the process name instead of the full command line.
* `highlight_megabytes=1`: If set to 1, displays memory usage in megabytes instead of kilobytes.
* `highlight_threads=0`: If set to 1, highlights threads with a different color.
* `tree_view=0`: If set to 1, shows the process list in a tree view.
* `header_margin=1`: If set to 1, adds an empty line between the header and the process list.
* `detailed_cpu_time=1`: If set to 1, shows detailed CPU time (user, system, and IO wait) instead of just the overall CPU usage percentage.
* `color_scheme=0`: Specifies the color scheme to use. 0 is the default color scheme.
* `delay=15`: Specifies the update delay in tenths of a second. In this case, it is set to 1.5 seconds.
* `left_meters=Hostname Tasks LoadAverage Uptime Memory Memory Swap CPU CPU`: Specifies the left-hand meters to display. In this case, it displays the hostname, number of tasks, load average, uptime, memory usage, swap usage, and CPU usage.
* `left_meter_modes=2 2 2 2 1 2 1 1 2`: Specifies the modes for the left-hand meters. 1 means text, 2 means a graphical bar.
* `right_meters=AllCPUs`: Specifies the right-hand meters to display. In this case, it displays the CPU usage for all CPUs.
* `right_meter_modes=1`: Specifies the mode for the right-hand meters. 1 means text.
