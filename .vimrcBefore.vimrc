" Add this line, because tComment is better
call janus#disable_plugin('nerdcommenter')

" This line calls a function provided by the Janus distribution of Vim to disable the 'nerdcommenter' plugin.
" This is being done because the user wants to use the 'tComment' plugin instead, which provides similar functionality but is preferred by the user for some reason.
" By disabling 'nerdcommenter', the user can avoid conflicts or confusion caused by having both plugins enabled at the same time.
